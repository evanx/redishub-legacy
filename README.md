## redishub.com

### Goals 

Build a site "redishub.com" with a foundational HTTP service for accessing and mutating Redis keys in a hosted "keyspace."

Provide a web admin console to inspect and manage keys.

Enable hosted "apps" to be configured, deployed and managed. These have managed access/permissions to one or more keyspaces. Allow keyspaces to be grouped for access control purposes.

### Status
