Note that (insecure) HTTP access to all RedisHub domains, and/or pathless URLs, are redirected to this info page.

### Goals 

Build a site "redishub.com" with a foundational HTTP service for accessing and mutating keys in a hosted Redis "keyspace." 

User stories:
- Use a free hosted Redis "keyspace" for specific low-volume purposes
- Deploy their own private "redishub" instance using the `rquery` opensource implementation

Future user stories:
- encrypted keys (using client cert)
- Manage the account admins and users
- Manage access to keyspaces
- Group/classify keyspaces for access control purposes
- Web admin console to inspect and manage keys
- Use disk-based keyspaces for archival
- Manage auto-archival of keys
- Enable a durable transaction log facilicity with playback for recovery
- Deploy Redishub "bots" to `bots.redishub.com` to build Redis-driven serverless backends
- Page bots generate web pages from React templates, populated with data from Redishub 

Redishub bots are special ES2016 scripts that use keyspaces for:
- pulling their configuration
- pushing logging messages e.g. info and errors
- pushing metrics e.g. for response time histograms, user geo distribution, et al
- messaging via Redis lists e.g. for microservice app architecture
- storing application state e.g. to support stateless microservices for auto-scaling
- persistent data storage via Redis keys e.g. values, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes, geo et al
